        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <p>
          At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
          facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of
          science and technologv. You seem like an intelligent. dedicated
          researcher. and rust the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
          Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued ov are
          as tollows, in order of prioritv:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of
            Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>10</sub>.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at
            temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size
            exponentiallv increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to
            3 x 10<sup>4</sup> )
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u>
            <span>constructs for representing musical scores.</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
          including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff
          and other resources, and anything else you think wed need to know?
          Thanks.

        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>
          Yes. vou are right. As part of mv post-doctorate work. I did studv
          exotic tribal dances. To answer vour question. my favourites are as
          followe. with definitions:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
          <dd>
            A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far
            as 300BC, a wh dance around in a circle like chickens. to encourage
            their livestock to be "fruittul'
          </dd>
          <dt>Icelandic hrownian shuffle</dt>
          <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,
            they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close
            together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
            in imperceptibly verv raold movements. One of my fellow students
            used to sav that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such
            as Twerking
          </dd>
          <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
          <dd>
            An interesting example or historie misinformation. English exnlorers
            in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style
            characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
            inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was
            discovered that they were just moving like this because the were
            really cold.
